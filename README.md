## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Instruction
I aim to deconstruct famous paintings into blocky colors, showing its structure step by step. I hope to reveal how these masterpieces are built. The falling particles that continuously form the image can draw the viewer's attention to the parts being painted. Computer animation can generate these falling particles and make them converge in the correct positions, which I find very interesting.
### Examples
#### It is an image of the falling particles.

#### I will convert the famous painting provided by our assignment to the blocky colors like this.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
### Instruction
The code example can help me achieve the effect of particles falling randomly. 
Additionally, with each user click, more particles will be generated, giving the user a sense of participation in the creation of the artwork, and allowing them to choose which part of the image to generate first.
